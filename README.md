# 🤝 **Skill Swap Platform** – Exchange Skills, Empower Each Other


>This project was developed as part of our academic initiative.
Skill Swap Platform is a collaborative and structured mini application that allows users to list skills they can offer and request others in return.
With user-friendly features, admin tools, and peer interaction, it encourages mutual learning and community growth.

# 📌 **Problem Statement** 
**Skill Swap – Learn by Teaching, Grow by Sharing**
Many individuals possess talents or knowledge but lack the means to share and exchange them in a structured, trusted environment. The Skill Swap Platform bridges this gap by enabling people to connect, collaborate, and swap skills—fostering a self-sustaining learning ecosystem.
